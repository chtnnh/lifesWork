* **Citation Tracking:** Use citation tracking tools like Google Scholar or Web of Science. Look for highly cited papers from the past 10-20 years. These are likely foundational works in your field.
**3. Build on the Foundation:**
* **Cited References:** Once you have a few key papers, explore their cited references. This will show you the earlier works that influenced those papers and build a chronological understanding.
* **Forward Citations:** Similarly, look at the papers that have cited your chosen foundational works. This will show you the latest research that builds upon those ideas.
**4. Leverage Online Resources:**
* **Field-Specific Repositories:** Many fields have online repositories like arXiv or Mendeley where researchers share their work. Explore these platforms to find recent pre-prints and working papers.
* **Conference Proceedings:** Look for the proceedings of major conferences in your field. These will contain cutting-edge research that may not yet be published in journals.
**5. Stay Updated:**
* **Scholar Alerts:** Set up Google Scholar alerts for keywords related to your field. This will notify you of new publications as they come out.
* **Join the Community:**  Engage with online forums or communities in your field. This is a great way to stay updated on current discussions and identify new research directions.
**Remember:**
* **Focus & Depth:** Don't try to read everything. Prioritise impactful papers and delve deep into them, taking detailed notes and following up on interesting references.
* **Critical Reading:**  Don't just absorb information. Develop your critical thinking skills by evaluating the methodology, findings, and limitations of each paper.
* **Own Your Journey:** This is your path to expertise. Tailor your reading list to your specific interests within the field and don't be afraid to explore tangential areas that pique your curiosity.

By following these steps and constantly seeking out new knowledge, you'll be well on your way to becoming a world expert in your field.

# Specific tips for AI / DL with my background in ML / DL
Certainly! With your background in Machine Learning and Deep Learning, we can tailor the research paper reading list for a more targeted approach towards becoming a world expert in Artificial Intelligence/Deep Learning. Here's how you can adapt the previous strategy:

**Foundational Knowledge Refresh:**

* Instead of a general Machine Learning textbook, consider "Deep Learning" by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville. This is a comprehensive reference for deep learning concepts and algorithms.

**Identify the Big Names and Papers:**

* Focus on researchers like Yann LeCun, Geoffrey Hinton, Fei-Fei Li, Yoshua Bengio, and Ian Goodfellow. Look for their recent review articles or influential papers like "ImageNet Classification with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks" by Krizhevsky et al. (2012) or "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition" by He et al. (2016).

**Build on the Foundation:**

* Explore the recent advancements in specific areas of interest within Deep Learning. 
    * For Computer Vision: Look at papers on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) or transformers for image recognition.
    * For Natural Language Processing (NLP): Explore papers on transformers for machine translation or question answering.
    * For Reinforcement Learning: Deep dive into Deep Q-Networks (DQNs) or Proximal Policy Optimisation (PPO) algorithms.

**Leverage Online Resources:**

* Follow leading Deep Learning research labs like OpenAI, DeepMind, Google AI, and Facebook AI on their publications pages or blogs. 
* Explore online courses offered by deeplearning.ai or fast.ai to learn about cutting-edge techniques and applications.

**Stay Updated:**

* Subscribe to conferences like NeurIPS, ICLR, CVPR for the latest research breakthroughs.
* Follow prominent researchers on Twitter or LinkedIn to stay updated on their work and discussions within the field.

**Additional Tips:**

* Consider attending research seminars or workshops to learn directly from experts and network with other researchers.
* Participate in online discussions or forums related to Deep Learning to broaden your perspective and stay engaged with the community. 
* Don't be afraid to tackle challenging papers. Push yourself to understand complex concepts and delve into the theoretical underpinnings of Deep Learning algorithms.

By focusing on these areas and actively engaging with the research community, you'll be well on your way to becoming a world-renowned expert in Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. Remember, the key is to continuously learn, explore new ideas, and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of the field.
