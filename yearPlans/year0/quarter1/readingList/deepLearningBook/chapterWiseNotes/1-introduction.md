# Key Points to note
1. "Inventors have long dreamed of creating machines that can think."
2. Early days of AI saw these systems solving problems that were relatively simpler for machines - problems explainable by formal mathematical rules.
3. Difficult problems for AI are the ones humans intuitively solve.
4. Deep Learning is about allowing computer systems to learn through experience and not just on the knowledge that human actors can specify.
5. DL does so by building abstractions for the computer systems.
6.
