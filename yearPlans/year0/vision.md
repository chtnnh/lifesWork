# Meta
## Self-Evaluation Matrix
1. All evaluations are self-evaluations
2. Two possible evaluation grades: done / learned
3. Many-to-one relationship between self-evaluation metrics and goals
## Strategy
1. There will be _one_ overarching theme for the year
2. Each quarter will have _one_ ambitious goal and 12 sprints
3. The last sprint of each quarter will be invested in review and planning for the next
4. Begin with a normal 50 (5 days * 10 hours) hour work week and continuously ramp up / down based on your discretion
5. Each sprint will be divided into 5 tasks initially, and the only requirement to mark a sprint _"done"_ is to get all 5 tasks _"done"_
6. Each day will only have 1 broad task, which will _not_ have subtasks
7. To mark a task _"done"_, all evaluation metrics for the task need to be _"done"_
## Requirements
1. Daily rituals followed with maximum realistic amount of discipline and effort
2. Holistic and well-balanced life apart from work
